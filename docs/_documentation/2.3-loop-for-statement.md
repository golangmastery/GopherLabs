#  Loop - For Statement

Let's have a look at [For statements](https://golang.org/ref/spec#For_statements) in the [Go spec](https://golang.org/ref/spec).

The `for` statement specifies _repeated execution of a block. There are three forms: The iteration may be controlled by a single condition, a `for` clause, or a `range` clause._

```go
ForStmt = "for" [ Condition | ForClause | RangeClause ] Block .
Condition = Expression .
```

This is not valid Go syntax. It's called [Extended Backusâ€“Naur form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form) (EBNF). EBNF is used to talk about a computer language.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	x := 1
	for x < 10 {
		fmt.Println(x)
		x++
	}
	fmt.Println("done.")
}
```

Continuing through the Go specification on [for statements](https://golang.org/ref/spec#For_statements), we come to "For statements with for clause," which looks like this:

```go
for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
	f(i)
}
```

The specification explains,

_A "for" statement with a ForClause is also controlled by its condition, but additionally it may specify an init and a post statement, such as an assignment, an increment or decrement statement._

Then, we have the EBNF explanation

```
ForClause = [ InitStmt ] ";" [ Condition ] ";" [ PostStmt ] .
```

If we relate this to the example above, `i := 0` is the `InitStmt`, `i < 10` is the `Condition`, and `i++` is the `PostStmt`.

Now, if we continue through the specification, it says

_The init statement may be a short variable declaration, but the post statement must not. Variables declared by the init statement are re-used in each iteration._

This further clarifies that the variable declared in the init statement is used in each iteration of the loop, and that we cannot have a short variable declaration in the post statment.

Continuing,

_If non-empty, the init statement is executed once before evaluating the condition for the first iteration; the post statement is executed after each execution of the block (and only if the block was executed)._

So, in the example the init statement `i := 0` is executed first. Then the condition `i < 10` is evaluated. _Then_, after the contents within the loop (the block) are executed, the post condition is executed.

Let's take a look at another way we could iterate through a for loop, and `break` when we are done.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	x := 1
	for {
		if x > 9 {
			break
		}
		fmt.Println(x)
		x++
	}
	fmt.Println("done.")
}
```
[playground](https://play.golang.org/p/egX34wR3wX)

That's an example of how we can use `for` on its own (without the init statement, condition, and post statement).

In addition to the [Go Specification](https://golang.org/ref/spec), another great resource for Go documentation is [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html). Let's have a look at what it has to say about [For](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#for)

_The Go for loop is similar toâ€”but not the same asâ€”C's. It unifies for and while and there is no do-while. There are three forms, only one of which has semicolons._

```go
// Like a C for
for init; condition; post { }

// Like a C while
for condition { }

// Like a C for(;;)
for { }
```
Notice how Effective Go jumps right to practical uses, whereas the Go Specification has a deeper explanation of the inner-workings. These two resources are excellent for diving into Go.
