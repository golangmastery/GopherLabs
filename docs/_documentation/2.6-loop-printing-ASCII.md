We previously learned how to print the different characters of a string with format printing. Refer to the docmentation for a refresher on the [fmt](https://golang.org/pkg/fmt/) package.

Loop through the numbers `33` through `122`, and print them out as numbers and text strings.

*Hint*: Refer to the [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) coding scheme to see the decimal and glyph representations.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	for i := 33; i < 122; i++ {
		fmt.Printf("%v\t%#U\n", i, i)
	}
}
```
