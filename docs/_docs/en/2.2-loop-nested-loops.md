Now, we're going to see a loop within a loop. There will be an _outer_ loop, and it will run however many times it runs, and inside that _outer_ loop will be an _inner_ loop, which will loop as many times as it loops _each time_ the outer loop loops.  
  
For example, if the outer loop loops 10 times, and the inner loop loops 5 times, the outer loop will loop once, then within that loop, the inner loop will loop 5 times, then the outer loop will loop its second time, and within that loop, the inner loop will loop 5 times, and so on...  
  
This is called nesting a loop; a loop within another loop. We can continue to nest loops within loops, but for now we'll stick with just one lopp within a loop.  
  
Let's give it a try.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	for i := 0; i <= 10; i++ {
		for j := 0; j < 3; j++ {
			fmt.Printf("Outer loop: %d\tInner loop: %d\n", i, j)
		}
	}
}
```

Here we can see for each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop prints out `0`, `1`, and `2`.   
  
Let's break this up and print `i` on the outer loop, and `j` on the inner loop. Try to do this with the output of the inner loop indented
  
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	for i := 0; i <= 10; i++ {
		fmt.Printf("Outer loop: %d\n", i)
		for j := 0; j < 3; j++ {
			fmt.Printf("\tInner loop: %d\n", j)
		}
	}
}

```
